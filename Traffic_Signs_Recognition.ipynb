Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.\n",

    "* Start with simple linear classifier on the data directly - like the previous lab - to test my use of tensorflow\n",

I used the cross entropy error function.  Between hidden layers I include relus.  Weights will be initialised to small random values sampled from a truncated_normal distribution.\n",
